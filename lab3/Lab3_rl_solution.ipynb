        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of the given world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing some provided reward function. Within a world, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback--in the form of positive or negative rewards--with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions. In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it's \"learned\".  \n",

        "In order to model our environment, we'll be using a toolkit developed by OpenAI, [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). It provides several pre-defined environments for training and testing reinforcement learning agents, including those for classic physics control tasks, Atari video games, and robotic simulations. To access the basic version of a control task, \"Cart Pole\", we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`. When we imported `gym`, we gained access to higher level functions in the package, including creating virtual worlds. Each environment has a specific identifier (for which you can read through [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)) which is accessed by passing the environment name as a string variable.\n",
        "One issue we might experience when developing RL algorithms is that many aspects of the learning process are inherently random: initializing game states, changes in the environment, and the agent's actions. As such, it can be helpful to set a random \"seed\" for one of these variables to ensure some level of reproducibility. Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time.
